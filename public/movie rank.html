<h1>Best Movies According to Emmanuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 series of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Vilkings</h3>

<p>I so much like Vilkings because of the show of strength, zeal, ambition of women to succeed and be rulers not just as mothers. I'm also a huge fan of this movie because it talks about resilence, never give up and to fight for our beliefs and righs. it's a clear movie of strategy and wisdom.</p>

<h3>lucifer</h3>

<p>lucifer is one of my favorite series because of it's comic scenes and the heavenly stories, Though they are not real but we can't deny the fact that they are amazing stories. The lucifer guy is a fantastic actor and he made the movie more than fastantic.</p>

<h3>S.W.A.T</h3>

<P>I'm a huge fan of this movie because of the action scenes, the rescue missions. It speaks alot security, and the efficiency of the police in our society. The lead character speaks alot about the black society and it's contribution to the community at large and not the regular ills it portrays out there.</P>
